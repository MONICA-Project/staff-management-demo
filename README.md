Start the situation map with some GPS dummies: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d loramap
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 to see the location map for the event "PÃ¼tzchens Markt" in Bonn with some moving fake staffers.

Start up a GOST server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d gost-dashboard
```

The GOST backend Postgres database takes a few seconds to start up. Make sure that the GOST API is available at http://localhost:8090/v1.0.

Start up SCRAL:

```bash
docker-compose up -d scral
```

Check if SCRAL is up and running at http://localhost:8000/scral/v1.0/gps-tracker-gw.

Register the fakers with SCRAL:

```bash
docker-compose up -d lorascral
```

The fakers should now be registered with SCRAL at http://localhost:8000/scral/v1.0/gps-tracker-gw/active-devices.

Observations should start coming in to GOST, visible in the dashboard at http://localhost:8090/#/observations.
